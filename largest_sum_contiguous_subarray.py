In computer science, the maximum subarray problem is the task of finding
the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.
 For example, for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4;
  the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6.
The problem was first posed by Ulf Grenander of Brown University in 1977,
as a simplified model for maximum likelihood estimation of patterns in digitized images.
 A linear time algorithm was found soon afterwards by Jay Kadane of Carnegie-Mellon University (Bentley 1984).
